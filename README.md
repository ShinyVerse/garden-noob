<h1>Garden Noob<h1>

Garden Noob is a small, quick project thought up to learn Nextjs.

If you'd like to learn more about Nextjs, they have a lovely tutorial for beginners, just go [here](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app)

The idea behind the project is to share some quick starter tips for new gardeners, tips I've gained along the way so far.

The deployed project can be found [here](https://garden-noob.vercel.app/)

<h2>What I liked about Nextjs<h2>
- The dynamic routes and template files that you could create - very cool.
- The css modules were an easy pattern to follow and kept the css from each component separate.
- The structure was a little fiddly at first, but was quick to get your head around and easy to follow once you had. 
- Deploying to Vercel was an absolute breeze.

<h2>Installation<h2>

Clone the repo and run:

`npm install`

and you should be good to go!

<h2>Built With<h2>
